In this Program two new buses are included :

1) Zero bus - Four parameters are unknown
2) PQVdelta - Substation bus (bus 1)

Description :
  This program can capable of determining the DG power injection.
  It can capable of absorbing the various power from grid(0 to 100%).
  Different voltage dependent load models are carried out(Constant Power, Constant Current & Constant Power). 


Input data file are there :
1.busxx.dat	- xx represents the bus numbers.


Output Files are in the form of "BusXXzero_AA_BB_MM.out"

Where,
  XX - bus number 
  AA - Percentage power absorption from grid
  BB - Zero bus number 
  MM - Model (Constant power, constant current & constant current)

zerobus.c is the main C file. 
Overall.c is also another main C file to determine the unknown quantities of all other buses by considering (zerobus) one at a time.

In order the get the different test system output, we have to change the data in Offline.txt file

*********************************************
Where to change in Offline.txt file

busXX.dat	-- XX may be 12 or 33 or 69 bus distribution system.
1Ybus.txt
2Volt.txt	-- Starting with 1,2,3,4 .txt are intermediate file.	
3Jaco.txt 	   to check our outputs at every step.
4Inv.txt
Resultxx	-- xx may be 5 or 12 or 33 or 69 bus distribution system.
